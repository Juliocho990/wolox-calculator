It was developed to be viewed on cell phones and allows access to two views, the first (potrait) allows basic arithmetic operations, the second (landscape) allows some extra operations such as trigonometrics, logarithmic and many more operations. The user has access to a historical view (log book) by clicking on the button in the upper left corner.
